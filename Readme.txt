# RPG Talent Tree Demo

This project is a small Unity demo that implements a circular talent tree inspired by Path of Exile. Talent nodes can grant basic stats, spells or minions to the player. The scripts in `Assets/Scripts` drive the generator and define the RPG stats structures.

Open the project in Unity 2022 or newer and run the scene containing the `RPG_TalentTreeGenerator` component to see the UI Toolkit based tree.
